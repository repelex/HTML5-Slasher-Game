****OVERVIEW****
You play as a character trapped in a mysterious cage. 
How did you get there. How can you get out? It looks like
the only way out is to fight. Fend off increasingly 
difficult enemies and try to beat your high score!

****CONTROLS****
WASD - Movement
Mouse - Move Camera
Left Mouse - Fire weapon
ESC - Pause

****INSTRUCTIONS****
Enemies are red cubes. Shoot them three times to kill 
them. They respawn faster as they die. The game ends when 
your health (the upper green bar) is depleted. Your high
score is saved between sessions. Beat your friends!

****NOTES****
Game is made using Three.js. Three.js acts as a buffer 
between WebGL and allows simple 3D design. Local 
storage is also used to track high scores.

Testing was done with Mozilla Firefox and coding was 
with Sublime Text 3. Performance should be fine on any 
modern browser, as the number of objects rendered at
any time is fairly low. 

Future additions may be different enemy type, weapons,
power-ups, etc.
